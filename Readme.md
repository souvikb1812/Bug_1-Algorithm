# Bug 1 Algorithm

The code implements the Bug 1 algorithm on a turtlebot using Gazebo and ROS.

[You may check out this slide for a better understanding of Bug Algorithms](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~motionplanning/lecture/Chap2-Bug-Alg_howie.pdf)

Following are two videos (excuse the poor quality) of my implementation. The turtlebot uses Bug 1 algorithm to move to the points.
